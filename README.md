# ScalaAlgorithms
This repository contains code for algorithms implemented using Scala
As of now following algorithms are implemented along with unit test cases. Haven't done performance analysis yet.

1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Fibonacci sequence generator
4. Problem of "calculating product of elements except itself" solved. This problem is given on leet code and is asked at FAANG companies.
5. Adding two numbers using linked list
